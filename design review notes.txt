Design Review Notes
- if train stops before station, how does train behind it stop in time?
	- 2 block padded authority
- track controller is vital
	- can change commanded speed and authority
- no train is longer than min. block size, train CANNOT span more than 1 block at a time
- signals cannot be global -- what if track end is 40 miles away?
	- controllers can't be aware of every block at one time
	- 1 to 2 block overlap for each controller
- sequence diagram -- show the objects actually placed after creation
	- i.e., show the new train placed in the yard
- CTC can communicate directly with track model for some instances
	- commanded speed, authority, etc. still have to go through track controller
	- can instantiate new trains directly to the train model (train_list)
